            <h3>Liability for content</h3>
            <p>
                The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee that the content is
                correct, complete or up-to-date. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
                pages in accordance with general laws in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 TMG. However, according
                to Sections 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored
                third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to
                remove or block the use of information in accordance with general law remain unaffected. However,
                liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. If
                we become aware of any corresponding legal violations, we will immediately remove this content.
            </p>

            <h3>Liability for links</h3>
            <p>
                Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. We
                therefore cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of
                the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
                possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not apparent at the time of
                linking. However, permanent control of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete
                evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will immediately remove
                such links.
            </p>

            <h3>Copyright</h3>
            <p>
                The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law.
                Reproduction, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law
                require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are
                only permitted for private, non-commercial use. If the content on this site was not created by the
                operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular contents of third parties are
                marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask that you notify
                us accordingly. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will immediately remove such content.
            </p>

            <h3>Data protection</h3>
            <p>
                It is generally possible to use our website without providing any personal data. As far as personal data
                (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done, as far as
                possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express
                consent.
                We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating via email)
                can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.
                The use of contact details published as part of the imprint obligation by third parties to send
                unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the
                pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising
                information being sent, such as spam emails.
